                <p>The computing innovation I chose is the Amazon Alexa. The artifact shows how it is used and the procedure to make Alexa do a command. The purpose of the Amazon Alexa is to help you complete technology based tasks with your voice. Today
                    people use the Amazon Alexa to help them in their everyday life such as; turning on the lights, order products online, or play their favorite songs.

                <p>The program I used to create this artifact is GIMP. First, I researched pictures that would show a visual representation on how Alexa works. After I found them, I copied and pasted them on to GIMP and edited them in order and by using
                    arrows to show Alexa's procedure. Using the text tool from GIMP I was able to write a brief summary on what Alexa's purpose is. Finally I added some final pictures to show how Alexa looks like.

                <p>The effect of this innovation is that it makes some task easier for people by just using their voice. Using your voice to make Alexa do different commands; like have more control over your calls, ordering online, controlling your music,
                    is a benefit for people. [1] This innovation is beneficial because if you are in the shower and someone is calling you, you can tell Alexa to answer the phone and then you are able to answer an important call. This can also be beneficial
                    because you could be busy doing something else like doing chores, and you could simply ask Alexa to order you food. This way you don’t take your own time from the things you are busy with, which could save you time. On the other hand,
                    this innovation is harmful because jobs like people working interaction or conversation based jobs could be taken away. [1] This is harmful for society because bigger companies, like McDonalds or Walmart, could use Alexa for user interactions.
                    There was around 3.5 million cashier jobs in the United states which means all those jobs could be at risk.[3] Cashiers or employees at McDonalds interact with people and do their commands, just like Alexa. If companies use Alexa then
                    they won’t need people to run a restaurant for example, when Alexa could do it just as well, and jobs would be lost making it tougher for working class people to find a job.

                <p>The data my innovation uses is audio input. It is collected with a built-in microphone if, say you speak the word “Alexa” which is its wake word meaning it will listen and do your command after you finish your phrase.[2] In other words,
                    it consumes audio, your voice, and produces a skill, your command. A privacy concern about the Amazon Alexa is that your recordings could be sold. This is a concern because Alexa records what you say, for example if you just wanted
                    to buy a bicycle online, so if they were to sell your recordings you would start seeing more advertisements for bicycles. This could potentially lead to selling further recordings, like how much time you are on your phone or what you
                    like to buy online. This is invading our privacy because they shouldn’t trick us into buying products with our recordings.
