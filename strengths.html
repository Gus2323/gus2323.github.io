                <h3 class="strengths">Organizer</h3>
                <p>Being organized makes you feel good. Making plans is important because it will help in the future. Also, it annoys you when you see something unorganized because you want things to be neat. It helps you strategize and it helps you find
                    things easier, that's why you like to be organized.
                </p>
                <p>I am organized because it is easier to find things. I don't like stressing over files or papers that are in the wrong place because it just takes more of my time. In addition, I like being organized because I know it will help me in the
                    future.
                </p>
                <p>It feels relieving to be organized. Being organized helps me plan ahead and lets me manage things better. It also helps me be less stressed because I know where I have everything and keeps me focused on other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <li>Keep track of work I need to get done</li>
                    <li>Focus on what I want</li>
                    <li>Organize files or papers</li>
                </p>

                <h3 class="strengths">Dependability</h3>
                <p>Being dependable shows that you are capable of doing things other people need help on.<br> For example you can be dependable by helping classmates when they don't understand <br> their homework. Being dependable means that you are thinking
                    about always getting <br> things done because you are responsible.
                </p>
                <p>Many people can count on me because they know I can keep my promises. I do what I am supposed to do even when no one is looking. Nobody needs to tell me what I have to get done because I already know what to do.</p>
                <p>It feels powerful to use this strength. I feel like I could change a lot if I make a mistake because other people depend on it, that's why it's important to me to be precise with what I do. For example, when someone wants to tell me a
                    secret they're trusting me to keep it, and it could make a major change if I do anything else than that. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Helping people</li>
                    <li>Keeping promises</li>
                    <li>Be on time</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="strengths">Future Thinker</h3>
                <p>Being a future thinker means you constantly keep thinking about the decisions you make and how they can affect your future. You think about what things could be like in the future and imagine different scenarios. It is important to vizualize
                    things that are important in the future than things happening today.</p>
                <p>Being a future thinker fits in my life because it is important to me to think about what is possible. It is important to me that I am doing the right things today so I can get where I want to in the future. I like to imagine what my life
                    would be like if I do different actions and how they can impact my life in a major way.</p>
                <p>It feels like I have a powerful mind when I think about my future. I think about things that will help me and not help me get to where I want to be in the future. This stregth helps me think about what colleges I want to go to and what
                    my life could be like in different types of jobs. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plan ahead of time</li>
                    <li>Help me make the right decisions</li>
                    <li>Get me closer to where I want to be</li>
                </ul>
