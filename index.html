    <div class="me">
        <p>My name is Gustavo Castaneda, I'm a 16 year old Sophomore at CCPA. I have a little sister and brother that I enjoy taking care of. We all live with our mom and dad. I was born in Mexico, and migrated to the United States when I was eight years
            old.

        <h1 class="strengths">Work</h1>
        <p>It took a long time to create a website, but in the end it was worth it because I took the skills that I learned this year and last year to publish a website online. It made me feel better because I can look back and see how hard I worked to get
            here.</p>
